# multy-app-integration

The repository contains two standalone React apps with a common Auth0 authentication, where signing in to one app automatically signs in the other.
App1 includes App2 within an iframe on a `/embedded-app` page of App1

To start open both apps directories and simply run `yarn start` in each.
